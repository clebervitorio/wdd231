        <p>This name was chosen because it reflects the moment when a person is looking for something for their party, and wants to provide a situation that will remain in the memory of the people who were invited to that event, allowing each person to experience this opportunity. The name is easy to remember and fits well with Kombine and Combie, in addition to being easy to remember.</p>
